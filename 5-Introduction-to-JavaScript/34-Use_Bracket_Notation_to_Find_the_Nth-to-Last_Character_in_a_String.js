// I learned that second to last character in a string is at -2, the third at -3, and so on. You can count backwards from the last character at -1.

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var thirdToLastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 3];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
var secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length -2];
