// I learned how to add variables into a string by using the + operator.

// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Guang Yeung";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
