// This lesson was about global scope. In Javascript, variables that are defined outside of function blocks have global scope. I learned that variables that are defined without the var keyword are automatically created in the global scope. It is best practice to define variables with var to avoid problems.


// Declare your variable here
var myGlobal = 10;

function fun1() {
  // Assign 5 to oopsGlobal Here
  oopsGlobal = 5;
}

// Only change code above this line
function fun2() {
  var output = "";
  if (typeof myGlobal != "undefined") {
    output += "myGlobal: " + myGlobal;
  }
  if (typeof oopsGlobal != "undefined") {
    output += " oopsGlobal: " + oopsGlobal;
  }
  console.log(output);
}
