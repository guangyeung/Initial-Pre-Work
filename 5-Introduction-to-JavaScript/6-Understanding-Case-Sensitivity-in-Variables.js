// This lesson was about case sensitivity of variables in Javascript. I learned that the best practice in Javascript is to write variable names in camelCase.

// Declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
